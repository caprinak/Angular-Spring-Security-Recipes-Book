# Recipe API Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
[ ] Implement a proper service layer between controllers and repositories
[ ] Refactor package structure to be more consistent (current mix of com.example.reciperestapi.recipe and com.example.reciperestapi.auth)
[ ] Implement proper exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
[ ] Add request/response DTOs to decouple API contracts from entity models
[ ] Implement mapper classes (using MapStruct or similar) to convert between entities and DTOs
[ ] Add pagination support for list endpoints
[ ] Implement proper HATEOAS links in responses

## Security Improvements
[ ] Move sensitive configuration (DB credentials, JWT secret) to environment variables or a secure vault
[ ] Implement role-based authorization (currently only authentication is implemented)
[ ] Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
[ ] Improve JWT token security (add claims validation, token revocation)
[ ] Implement proper password policy enforcement
[ ] Add CSRF protection for non-GET endpoints
[ ] Configure security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
[ ] Implement IP-based blocking for repeated failed authentication attempts

## Code Quality
[ ] Add input validation using Bean Validation (JSR 380)
[ ] Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application
[ ] Add Javadoc comments to all public methods and classes
[ ] Refactor RecipeController to use a service layer
[ ] Make database operations atomic where appropriate (e.g., replaceAllRecipes)
[ ] Add null checks and defensive programming practices
[ ] Implement consistent error response format
[ ] Add request/response logging for debugging

## Data Model Improvements
[ ] Add validation constraints to entity classes
[ ] Implement auditing fields (createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, etc.)
[ ] Consider using a numeric type for Ingredient.amount instead of String
[ ] Add a unit field to Ingredient entity
[ ] Consider using a more structured approach for Recipe.imagePath (e.g., separate entity for images)
[ ] Add indexes to frequently queried fields
[ ] Implement soft delete instead of hard delete where appropriate

## Testing
[ ] Increase unit test coverage (aim for at least 80%)
[ ] Add integration tests for all endpoints
[ ] Implement test data factories for easier test setup
[ ] Add performance tests for critical endpoints
[ ] Implement contract tests to ensure API compatibility
[ ] Add security tests (authentication, authorization, input validation)
[ ] Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically

## DevOps and Infrastructure
[ ] Configure different profiles for dev, test, and production environments
[ ] Implement database migration tool (Flyway or Liquibase) instead of hibernate.ddl-auto=update
[ ] Set up Docker containerization for the application
[ ] Configure connection pooling for better database performance
[ ] Implement health check endpoints
[ ] Add metrics collection (Micrometer/Prometheus)
[ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
[ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Documentation
[ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
[ ] Create a comprehensive README with setup instructions
[ ] Document authentication flow and token handling
[ ] Add code examples for common API operations
[ ] Create architecture diagrams
[ ] Document database schema
[ ] Add contributing guidelines

## Feature Enhancements
[ ] Implement search functionality for recipes (by name, ingredients, etc.)
[ ] Add support for recipe categories/tags
[ ] Implement user favorites or ratings for recipes
[ ] Add support for recipe comments
[ ] Implement proper image upload and storage
[ ] Add support for recipe sharing
[ ] Implement recipe versioning to track changes
[ ] Add support for nutritional information
